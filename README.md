## Calculator UI Tests

![UI Tests](https://github.com/luuizeduardo/ts-calculator-ios/workflows/Swift/badge.svg)

This project tests the Calculator app in the UI level.

You can find the scripts that I create in the SwiftUIUITests folder.

The project is organized following the Page Object model.

### Technologies used

- Xcode 12.3
- iPhone simulator running on iOS 14.3

### Running the tests

To run the UI tests go to **Product > Test** in the menu section. Or press `command + u` with the project opened.

### Issues

As I can only open issues in the main project and don't think it's the best solution for this particular case, I decide to create a project [here](https://github.com/luuizeduardo/ts-calculator-ios/projects/1) and documented the bugs and improvements that I found out. The list of tickets is prioritized by severity.

Some automated tests are failing because of these issues, so it's supposed this status until we fix those issues.
