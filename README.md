## Calculator UI Tests

![UI Tests](https://github.com/luuizeduardo/ts-calculator-ios/workflows/.github/workflows/swift.yml/badge.svg)

This project tests the Calculator app in the UI level.

You can find the scripts that I create in the SwiftUIUITests folder.

The project is organised following the Page Object model.

**P.s.**: As I can only open issues in the main project and don't think it's the best solution for this particular case, I decide to create a project [here](https://github.com/luuizeduardo/ts-calculator-ios/projects/1) and documented the bugs and improvements that I found out. The list of tickets is prioritized by severity.
